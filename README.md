Context
Lab Two is about understanding the basics of Laravel: the folder structure, how the web server responds to requests, basic MVC architecture that the framework implements, and how to add a new "page" in a project like this and see results in the browser.

We covered the local app setup during the class, now using the tutorials video that I sent, complete the below tasks.


Create a model, controller, route, and view using tutorial.


Create a feature branch for your work git checkout -b your-feature-branch
Commit your changes: git add -A && git commit -m "your commit message"
Push your feature branch to Github: git push origin your-feature-branch
Create a pull request in Github
